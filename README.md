# Multiple Wind Velocity Fields Visualization

This reposity includes the files developed in article https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116656. This article introduces an algorithm for the visualization of the wind velocity in which cloud are flowing. This algorithms uses infrared sky images. See article https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.106914 for more information about the sky imager.

## Velocity Vectors Processing

The velocity vectors are processed to reduce the computational burden of the algorithm using the functions implemented in this XX. The implementation of the Lucas-Kanade algorithm is in this repository https://github.com/gterren/multiple_cloud_dection_and_segmentation, and the segmentation of clouds is in this repository https://github.com/gterren/cloud_segmentation.

## Multi-output Support Vector Regression with Flow Constrains

The different implementation of the SVR in the experiments of the articles are in this file XX. The function that are to process the wind velocity field are in XX.
